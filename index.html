	<h2>Gamers online as of <span class="numbers" id="asof"></span></h2>

	<p>Looking for information on games in the Xbox Live ecosystem?
You've come to the right place.
My pet project is 10 years old and is an unofficial source of information regarding Xbox Live games on various devices.
This page shows what games players are playing right now.
You can (and should) filter the parameters you're interested in.<p>

	<p>Below is the graph of the activity for the last 24 hours. 
	You can select country in the corresponding table 
	and see when there is a peak amount of gamers in that particular country.</p>

	<p>All other tables show players as of "right now", 
	only those who have launched the game in the last 24 hours 
	and are still playing.</p>


	<div id="hourly"></div>

	<h3>Devices</h3>

	<input type="button" value="Reset filters" />

	<p>The Xbox ecosystem allows you to play on a variety of devices.
	So, you can play Minecraft on almost anything.
	And if you are signed into your Xbox live account in the game, you will appear in this table.</p>

	<p>If you play an Xbox One game on an Xbox Series, it will be counted as an Xbox Series.
	If you play an Xbox 360 game on an Xbox One or Xbox Series, 
	the tables will list the game twice with the same name, 
	one of which will correspond to the game id on the Xbox 360 platform, 
	the second will refer to the backward compatibility environment. 
	The environment will indicate the appropriate device -- One or Series.</p>
	
	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="devices" class="stdtab">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Genres</h3>
	<p>Genre in the Xbox Live ecosystem is a controversial parameter. 
	It is a mystery to me how exactly the genre is assigned, I did not find any documents, 
	although it is impossible that MS did not describe the requirements for this field. 
	The fact is that some games do not specify it at all or specify the most suitable one, 
	but some incomprehensible 
	<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rec-room/9PGPQK0XTHRZ" target="_blank">Rec Room</a> 
	included almost all genres, and it gets away with it.</p>

	<p>The number of players in the table is the number of unique gamertags that played this genre. 
	If a game has many genres, each of them will receive +1 from each player. 
	This is why the "All" line in the Genres table has a number of players 
	that significantly exceeds the total number of players.</p>

	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="genres" class="stdtab">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Countries</h3>
	<p>Every time a player takes a screenshot or records a clip in the game, 
	in addition to the date/time, game title, platform, and player name, 
	the locale settings are also recorded in their feed. 
	Some games can record a clip themselves, like Forza Horizon 2 
	does in some key plot moments. 
	If you haven't made a single clip or screenshot in 10 years of gaming, 
	then I have no way to know your locale, 
	and I won't scan your account. 
	Or if you take screenshots and clips, 
	but your security settings prohibit everyone 
	except your friends from viewing them, for example. 
	Or if your account is a child account, there are some really severe restrictions.</p>

	<p>An important note regarding the "GB" country: 
	I had to add "+ Others" because I have no other explanation for the number of players, 
	other than the hypothesis that for all countries that are not on the official Xbox supported list, 
	players specify this locale (GB-EN).</p>

	<input type="text" size="40" placeholder="Filter country names..." id="filter-countries" />
	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="countries" class="stdtab">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Languages</h3>

	<p>You might be wondering how it happened that the table of countries and languages 
	includes many unsupported languages on Xbox?
	I suppose that a player could have once played under their Live account on PC, 
	where the choice of locales is much larger, 
	and filmed a game clip or took a screenshot there.</p>

	<p>In any case, you have the opportunity to find a companion from your country 
	or who speaks your language.</p>

	<p>Some countries have two official languages, for example, Canada or Switzerland. 
	You can see which language is more common by selecting a country and comparing 
	the number of players who indicated one or another language.</p>

	<input type="text" size="40" placeholder="Filter language names..." id="filter-langs" />
	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="langs" class="stdtab">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Games</h3>
	<p>The game name is generally a rather unreliable parameter. 
	For example, Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox 360 and on Xbox One 
	are two completely different games. 
	And the table will have two identical lines. 
	How to distinguish them? 
	Select one of them and look at the list of platforms.</p>

	<p>It also happens the other way around, 
	when one game has many names, like Minecraft. 
	It has a different id on different platforms.</p>

	<p>It also happens that the GOTY Edition has a different id 
	from the main game.</p>

	<p>The table shows the first 150 games, 
	and if you are interested in a game not in the first hundred, 
	then just type part of the name in the filter field. 
	If nothing is found, 
	then no one is playing this game at the moment.</p>
	
	<input type="text" size="40" placeholder="Filter title names..." id="filter" />
	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="titles" class="stdtab">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>Players</h3>

	<p>Finally, if you've set the right filters in the tables above, 
	here you'll see a list of players in the order of "whoever started the game later 
	is higher in the list". First 150 gamers are shown.
	A great way to find a companion from your country or in a long-forgotten game.</p>

	<p>Right now <span class="numbers" id="gtready"></span> gamertag names are got.
	</p>

	<table class="scrollable"><tbody id="gamers">
			<tr class="placeholder"><td>Loading...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<h3>How it works</h3>

	<input type="button" value="Reset filters" />

	<p>Every <span class="numbers" id="avgtime"></span> minutes my scripts scan the state (
	<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/docs/reference/live/rest/uri/presence/atoc-reference-presence" target="_blank">Presence</a>
	) of <span class="numbers" id="xuids"></span> players.
	Presence shows which game is currently running and on which device. 
	I store this information in the 
	<a href="https://postgrespro.com/products/postgrespro/enterprise" target="_blank">Postgres Pro Enterprise</a> DBMS. </p>
	
	<p>A separate pool of scripts attempts to get a list of clips and screenshots, 
	from which I determine the country and language. 
	Another scripts are determining the Gamertag. 
	And another set of scripts continuously expands the list of gamers
	by brute-forcing the id.</p>

	<p>I do not scan players for whom it was not possible to determine the language/country.</p>

	<p>The entire complex consists of three dedicated servers 
	that receive the necessary information from 50+ artificial accounts. 
	The main problem is not to cause problems for the Xbox Live servers, 
	for which I observe 
	<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/docs/services/develop/best-practices/live-fine-grained-rate-limiting" target="_blank">Fine-Grained Rate Limiting</a>.</p>

	<p>Let me summarize a bit</p>

	<ul>My sample does NOT include
		<li>players who set the "invisible" ("offline") status</li>
		<li>players who did not take a single screenshot or record a single video</li>
		<li>offline players who disconnects from the Internet</li>
		<li>players who have a "child account" profile (under 18 years old), 
			for them there are some kind of cruel restrictions on requesting information</li>
		<li>who have not yet reached the turn of my brute-forcer</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It would seem that my sample is crap. 
	But - tens of millions of players who passed through all these filters do not allow me to say that, 
	and give a very truthful picture of what is happening on game stage.</p>


	<h3>Custom reporting</h3>
	<p>Yes, I keep all the information avbove since Febriary 2024. 
	For example, <span class="numbers" id="active"></span> gamers were active last week.
